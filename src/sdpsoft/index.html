            <p>SDPSoft is a collection of compiled software stored under <strong>/prog/sdpsoft</strong> for all Statoil Linux servers that have the "official" NFS-share mounted. SDPSoft exists because people need various types of software and new versions of software which is neither available in RedHat's yum repos nor Statoil yum repos. Also, instead of having to deal with yum repos and packages that needs to be installed and/or updated on all servers in Statoil (which SDPTeam have no responsiblity for), we use the NFS-share as an easy alternative to provide our compiled software to the people. SDPSoft is available on all the Statoil offices around the world.</p>
            <h2 style="margin: 1em 0 1em 0;">How to use SDPSoft</h2>
            <p>
            SDPSoft recently got redesigned to only give you software you ask for. You ask for software by defining a set of environment variables before you <em>source</em> the <em>env</em> script. Let's say you wanted Python version 3.6.4 and QT version 5.9.1, in <strong>bash</strong>, you would do:
            </p>
            <section class="code">
                export PYTHON_VERSION="3.6.4"<br />
                export QT_VERSION="5.9.1"<br />
                source /prog/sdpsoft/env.sh
            </section>
            <p>And in <strong>csh</strong>, you would've done:</p>
            <section class="code">
                setenv PYTHON_VERSION "3.6.4"<br />
                setenv QT_VERSION "5.9.1"<br />
                source /prog/sdpsoft/env.csh
            </section>
            <p style="margin: 1em 0;">This will update all the necessary PATH varialbes specific to the software you asked for.</p>
            <p>The env-scripts also supports:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 2em;">
                <li>Searching for software in SDPSoft</li>
                <li>The output from the script can be silenced</li>
                <li>You can use the word <em>latest</em> as a version when sourcing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of these features and how to use SDPSoft can be found in the env-scripts help function, for <strong>bash</strong> that is:</p>
            <section class="code">
                source /prog/sdpsoft/env.sh --help
            </section>
            <p>And for <strong>csh</strong> it is:</p>
            <section class="code">
                source /prog/sdpsoft/env.csh --help
            </section>
            <h2 style="margin: 1em 0 1em 0;">Deprecation note</h2>
            <p>Before the new env-scripts were created, sourcing SDPSoft was done with <strong>environment.sh</strong> and <strong>environment.csh</strong>. You can to some degree specify what software you want with these scripts, but they also do some assumptions to what software you might want as well. If you don't specify anything, you'll get the latest version of various software.</p>
            <p>This design made maintainance of SDPSoft hard. New distributed software had to be just right and perfectly compiled without any breaking changes. Due to limited time for testing new software, we're now moving away from these scripts.</p>
